# ServiQue – A Service-Based Platform
 
## 📌 Project Overview

**ServiQue** is a Java Swing-based desktop application that provides a unified platform for customers to access a wide range of **home and personal care services** — including salons, appliance repairs, pest control, and more — from the comfort of their homes. It handles the complete lifecycle of service booking: from request to delivery to feedback.

Built using Java Swing for the frontend and **DB4O** (Database for Objects) for backend storage, ServiQue brings efficiency, reliability, and scalability to local service delivery management.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Urban users often struggle to find **trustworthy service professionals** for essential home and personal tasks. Existing systems are fragmented, requiring customers to contact multiple technicians or providers individually. There is no centralized system to:
- Book appointments seamlessly

- Get quality assurance or track service status

## 💡 Proposed Solution

ServiQue bridges the gap between **service seekers** and **service providers** by offering:
- A consolidated platform for various service domains
- Professional onboarding and scheduling system
- Customer-friendly UI with reliable feedback mechanism
- A fully offline desktop solution with persistent data using DB4O
